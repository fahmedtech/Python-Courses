Implement a function CoinProb() that takes no parameters and enters
a positive integer n from the user.  The value n represents the number of
tosses of a fair coin.  The function checks that n is positive (> 0).
If it is not, it prints an error message.  If n is positive the function
prints the probability of getting n heads in a row when tossing a coin n times.
That probability can be computed as 1 divided by 2 to the power n.
You may assume that the user will enter an integer when prompted.

>>> CoinProb()
Enter the Number of Coin Tosses: 1
Probability of 'Heads' in a row for 1 tosses is:  0.5
>>> CoinProb()
Enter the Number of Coin Tosses: 2
Probability of 'Heads' in a row for 2 tosses is:  0.25
>>> CoinProb()
Enter the Number of Coin Tosses: 10
Probability of 'Heads' in a row for 10 tosses is:  0.0009765625
>>> CoinProb()
Enter the Number of Coin Tosses: 0
Invalid Number of Coin Tosses!
>>> CoinProb()
Enter the Number of Coin Tosses: -3
Invalid Number of Coin Tosses!

Write a function customSpam() that takes as parameters a string containing
a first name followed by a space followed by a last name, a string representing
a dollar amount spelled out in words, and string representing an e-mail
address and prints a customized spam solicitation to the person using their
name, the dollar amount, and the e-mail address.  The name should use a
capitalized letter for the first and last name regardless of the capitalization
of the string entered and the dollar amount should be in all caps with spaces
between each letter.

as parameters.  It prints the strings in the list that begin with a letter
at or after the character (according to dictionary order), one per line.

should not make a difference in whether the string is printed.  Empty strings
should be skipped.  You may assume that the character given as the second
parameter is an upper- or lowercase letter.

Write a function points() that takes as parameters four numbers x1, y1, x2, and
y2 that are coordinates of two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in the plane.
Your function should compute:
a.	The slope of the line going through the points,
        unless the line is vertical
b.	The distance between the two points
The function should print the computed slope and distance in the following way:
if the line is vertical, the value of the slope should be the string 'infinity'.
Otherwise the slope and distance will be printed as computed normally.
If you donâ€™t know how to compute the slope and distance find a reference,
for example Wikipedia. Make sure to convert the slope and distance values
to strings before printing them to avoid extra spaces.
