#Program 1:
'''
Write a Program called pizzaPrice that takes two parameters for size and
toppings. A small size pizza would cost $12.00 with an additional $.75 for the
toppings. A medium size pizza would cost $15.00 with an additonal $1.25 for the
toppings. A large size pizza would cost $17.00 with an additional $1.50 for the
toppings. Your output should be returned and not printed.

>>> pizzaPrice("Small", 2)
13.5
>>> pizzaPrice('M', 3)
18.75
>>> pizzaPrice("Large", 3)
21.5
'''
#Run Module for Program to execute (F5)
#Type pizzaPrice(<string> / <char>,  <integer>) - Name of Method in Shell to execute.



#Program 2:
'''
Write a Program called wordsOfLength that takes two parameters (one for the
string of words) and the (other for the number of characters). Print the words
that matches the inputted value in the second parameter.

>>> wordsOfLength("string words five four ok", 4)
five
four
'''
#Run Module for Program to execute (F5)
#Type wordsOfLength(<string>, <integer>) - Name of Method in Shell to execute.



#Program 3:
'''
Write a Program called PrintBs() that takes a parameter of Lists that contains
float values ranged from 0-100. Print a new list of values that are greater
than or equal to 80 and less than 90.

>>> PrintBs([56.5, 82.3, 65.8, 91.6, 93.8, 85.1, 80.0])
[82.3, 85.1, 80.0]
'''
#Run Module for Program to execute (F5)
#Type PrintBs(<list>) - Name of Method in Shell to execute.



#Program 4:
'''
Write a Program that counts all of the uppercase Alphabets in the inputted
string. Name the Program countCaps that takes one parameter for the string.
Your Program should return and NOT Print the final count.

>>> str_files = "dogs.EXE, Cats.exe, ViRuS.exe"
>>> countCaps(str_files)
7

Hint: Import string and use ascii_uppercase letters for comparisons

#Run Module for Program to execute (F5)
#Type countCaps(<string>) - Name of Method in Shell to execute.
